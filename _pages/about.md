<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I'm an Assistant Professor in the
  <a href="https://cah.fresnostate.edu/mcll/index.html">Department of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures</a>
  at California State University, Fresno. I am a linguist and I specialize in language acquisition, sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics. In my research I focus primarily on morphosyntactic features and I draw upon functional approaches to language research, including variationist and usage-based approaches. In my free time I enjoy going to the movies, playing adventure videogames, and eating peanut butter cups.
