## Abstract

**Aims and Objectives:** This study empirically examines cross-linguistic interference and
gender‑based differences in the production of 3rd person subjects in both languages (Spanish and
English) of balanced bilingual Latinx children in eastern North Carolina.
**Methodology:** We elicited picture book retells of Mayer’s “Frog, where are you?” in both
languages of 14 bilingual kindergarten children (mean age of 67 months).
**Data and Analysis:** We explored 817 tensed verb phrases to test how language mode
(Spanish/English), gender (boys/girls), and linguistic factors (e.g., topic continuity and number)
affected subject expression across languages.
**Findings:** Results indicate significant differences in subject form rates based on language mode,
gender, topic continuity, and verb number. The children show a general command of the linguistic
constraints for subject expression in each language, with girls using more null subjects than the
boys in Spanish mode.
**Originality:** We test subject expression in both languages of each bilingual participant to explore gender-based language variation among children in a region with a fast-growing Latinx population.
**Significance:** The children have similar proficiencies in both languages, which offers a snapshot
of the developing bilingual system when the effects of language interference may be lessened. At
a young age, these bilingual kindergarteners are sensitive to the linguistic patterning of each
language, with differences based on gender adding to our understanding of subject expression.
