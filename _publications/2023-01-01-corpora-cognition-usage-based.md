## Abstract

This chapter discusses the compatibility of usage-based approaches with increasingly sophisticated corpus research and considers the study of usage-based factors across different corpora, languages, and linguistic structures. It explores pending issues related to understudied phenomena, languages, regional varieties, and language users, as well as the ability of corpora to serve as primary and/or supplementary data. The chapter explains the cognitive-functional origins of usage-based approaches to language development, key constructs within these approaches, and their compatibility with advanced corpus methodologies. It also discusses the scope of usage-based corpus analyses, ways in which corpora can inform more controlled measures of data elicitation, and the languages and types of users considered. Usage-based linguists will continue to uncover information about human cognition across different structures, languages, regional varieties, levels of language expertise, and language pairings.
