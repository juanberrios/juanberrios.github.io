## Abstract

This study examines variation in the expression of progressive aspect in Spanish across different temporal reference frames, focusing on the alternation between synthetic forms (e.g., *cantaba*) and analytic progressive constructions (e.g., *estaba cantando*). Drawing on data from native speakers and second language learners of Spanish, we investigate how tense–aspect combinations, lexical aspect, and discourse-level factors condition the use of progressive morphology. Using mixed-effects regression modeling, the analysis reveals both shared and divergent patterns across L1 and L2 speakers, highlighting the role of usage-based factors and crosslinguistic influence in shaping aspectual choice. The findings contribute to our understanding of aspectual variation in Spanish and provide insight into how learners acquire and deploy progressive morphology across temporal contexts.
